## Software Development Lifecycle ##
**Spring 2021: Because of the seven-week term schedule, the following tasks for the Software Development Lifecycle are optional –– you don't have to do them.**

This document is written in a language called Markdown, which is similar to HTML or other text-formatting languages. A helpful cheat sheet for Markdown is [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

Note that the code for Markdown and what appears in GitHub are not the same. I will be looking at what appears in GitHub, so you should definitely check GitHub before you consider your submission complete.

## INITIAL DESIGN PLAN:

Design a plan which meets the computational requirements to solve the problem. Your plan does not need to be syntactically correct. It needs to capture the flow of logic in a human readable format.

For example:
1. Capture user input about how many balls they want to put in the basket
2. Use a conditional to see if the number is greater than 15
3. ...

:exclamation: **The Initial Design Plan is due by Friday. Replace this text and the text above with your design. Do this section before you begin coding.**

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:

Look at the flow of logic above, and determine a set of functions that allow you to complete all of the steps above. Function names often reflect the function's purpose (e.g., ```calculate_size()``` clearly calculates the size of something).  

- ```ask_for_number_of_balls()```
- ...

:exclamation: **The Implementation Plan is due by Friday. Replace this text and the text above with your design. Create a list in bullet form of each function you created, and what is each function’s purpose. Do this section before you begin coding.**

## TESTING:

Test-driven development teaches us that we can write tests before writing code (i.e., functions). Provided you named your functions clearly above, and can identify that the functions are fruitful functions, writing a test suite is straightforward.

:exclamation: The Test Suite is due by Monday. Using T05 as a model, create a test suite in your repository that should pass for each function that is fruitful. You can test any code that has a return value. You are not expected to write tests for functions that are not fruitful (e.g., functions that do Turtle drawings, functions whose purpose is to print, or functions that only return None). Remove this text when you've completed your test suite.

## ERRORS:

Create a bulleted list of all known errors and deficiencies in your implementation.

Replace this text and the text above with your design. Do this section *while you are coding* and notice errors. Some you may even fix before you're finished!

## REFLECTION:

Write a paragraph or two about your reactions to this assignment. What went well? What didn't go as planned? Where'd you get stuck? How did you get unstuck? Consider these seed questions; you should write about what is pertinent to your experience in this assignment.

:exclamation: **Replace this text and the text above with your reflection. Do this section after you finish coding, before your final submission.**
